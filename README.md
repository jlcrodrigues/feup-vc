# Computer Vision

This repository contains the work developed at the Computer Vision Curricular Unit @ Feup.
It includes labs, as well as the project work, detailed below.

For more information, check out the [first](project/report-1.pdf) (Task 1) and [second](project/report-2.pdf) (Tasks 2 & 3) reports.

 - **Task 1**: Detect the presence of LEGO pieces in images and characterize their position and color, using traditional methods.
 - **Task 2**: Identify the number of LEGO bricks on an image by employing Deep Learning Models based on CNN architectures.
 - **Task 3**
   - **3.1**: Detect LEGO pieces using object detection models, such as YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN.
   - **3.2**: Perform traditional segmentation within bounding boxes derived from object detection done in the task before, followed by a qualitative assessment of the segmentation quality.
